*This what good email friend send to Hulk ðŸ¥¹*

Good evening dear hulk, today i will be sharing my burning passion for
musical theatre! When i stand on the stage, its like i've come home. I
loooove singing and dancing and acting so it's only so splendid that you
do all of them in musical theatre! Unfortunately there is not many
musicals going on in my area, so i can not really evolve this passion so
deeply at the moment. My biggest dream is to act on broadway!
